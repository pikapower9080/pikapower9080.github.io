        <h1>Getting Started Guide</h1>
        <h3>New to the server? Great! Here's what to do:</h3><br>
        <p>
            <h3>The Wild Portal</h3>
            The wild portal can be found at spawn. It is made of glass panes and glazed terricotta. Touch the glass panes inside of the portal to enter. You will be randomly teleported to somewhere in the world after a short delay.<br>
            <h3>Homes + Spawn</h3>
            If you're not looking for a server with /home or /spawn, don't use those commands. If traveling 5k blocks to visit your friend and say hello is your thing, go ahead! Otherwise, use /spawn or /trigger spawn to teleport to spawn after a delay and with a cooldown. You may not move during this delay. To set your home, stand where your home should be and do /sethome. Later you can use /home or /trigger home to teleport home after a delay and with a cooldown, much like /spawn.
            <h3>Bans</h3>
            I shouldn't have to say this, but doing anything at all that breaks the golden rule, i.e. cheating, griefing, etc you'll be banned as soon as possible. If you see someone who you think should be banned, ping the @mod role on our discord and after an investigation, they will be banned as soon as possible.
            <h3>Feedback?</h3>
            Got feedback? We'd LOVE to hear it! Since OxygenCloud is a new server, expect that things will be changed. If you'd like to have your voice heard, fill out our feedback form which is accessed by doing the /links command in game.
