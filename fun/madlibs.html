There's a big fence around the area with a sign that says "No tresspassing!" in big, red letters. You ignore it and promptly use the ${noun2} to cut through it. You climb through the hole in the fence and get this chill down your spine, This place is giving you some serious chills. It's completely abandoned and upon further investigation, you find out that nobody's been here for a very long time. "${curse1}!" Exclaims ${friendName} You look down and find that he's tripped over his shoelaces. You help him up but then look again at where he fell. There's a big hole in the ground, It's really deep; ${friendName} tossed a rock down and you couldn't hear it hit anything. Of course, your adventurous side gets the better of you and suddenly you and ${friendName} are climbing down into the deep depths using a ${noun3} you found lying around.
