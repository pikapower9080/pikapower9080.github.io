    <h4>There are multiple ways to install, if one way doesn't work for you, check the other.</h4>
    <details>
        <summary>Find your world folder in game</summary>
        <p>The option is usually the best, just launch minecraft, then create a new world or find an old one.</p>
        <p>Then if you're in the world, close out of it and click the singleplayer tab again if you need to so you should now be on the world selection screen</p>
        <p>Next click on the world you chose in step one. Don't play the world just select it</p>
        <p>Now in the bottom bar click edit and in that menu click open world folder.</p>
        <p>Now a folder for your world should be opened. Locate the datapacks folder inside there.</p>
        <p><a href="/assets/downloads/EffectBlocks.zip">Download</a> the datapack and drag it over into the datapacks folder</p>
        <p>And you're done!</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>Find your world folder via your minecraft folder</summary>
        <p>This one is generally a bit harder because it varries between computers but here's the gist:</p>
        <h3>Windows:</h3>
        <p>Press windows key + r. A window should open called "run" with a prompt to enter a folder path.</p>
        <p>Type in %appdata% and then press enter. A folder should open up with a bunch of folders. Each of these is for a different app</p>
        <p>Find .minecraft (show hidden folders if you dont see it if that won't work type %appdata%\.minecraft instead)</p>
        <p>Now you should be at a folder with various things like "saves" and "resource packs". This is your minecraft folder. It has all minecraft related files.</p>
        <p>Now locate the saves folder and select a world inside of there. Open up that folder and find "datapacks".</p>
        <p><a href="/assets/downloads/EffectBlocks.zip">Download</a> the datapack and drag it over into the datapacks folder</p>
        <h3>Mac:</h3>
        <p>Make sure you're not focused on any application (click on your desktop and you should see finder next to the apple logo in the top)</p>
        <p>Press Command + Shift + G and type in /Library/Application Support/minecraft (if you get an error, try /Users/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/Library/Application Support/minecraft)</p>
        <p>Now you should be at a folder with various things like "saves" and "resource packs". This is your minecraft folder. It has all minecraft related files.</p>
        <p>Now locate the saves folder and select a world inside of there. Open up that folder and find "datapacks".</p>
        <p><a href="/assets/downloads/EffectBlocks.zip">Download</a> the datapack and drag it over into the datapacks folder</p>
    </details>
    <h3>Ready to download?</h3>
    <p>Now that you know how it works and how to install it, you can download the pack. (If you didn't already click one of the links)</p>
