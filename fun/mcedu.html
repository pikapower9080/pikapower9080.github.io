        <h1>Minecraft Education Edition</h1>
        <p>So, you might be thinking that Minecraft education is just a lame attempt at teaching kids stuff through a hip and cool video game.</p>
        <p>You would be wrong. (Sort of)</p>
        <p>
            Minecraft education edition is really just Minecraft Bedrock / PE but with a few extras and more accessible.<br>
            If your school buys it, then everyone automatically gets full access. A new update also allows clubs and other stuff like that instead of just schools.
             Read more about that <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/get-started/camps-and-clubs" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, now you know what it is, here's a quick rundown. You'll most likely be asked to sign in with your Microsoft account, so do that.
            If you're getting MCEE from your school, use your school account.<br>
            Once you're logged in, you should see a screen that looks something like this.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/mcee-welcome.png" width="50%">
        <p>Click play.</p>
        <p>From here, you're left with a choice. You can just jump right into the game (Good for if you've played Minecraft before), or you could do one of the tutorial worlds.</p>
        <p>The tutorial worlds should show you around, and you should be able to figure the rest out yourself. Here, I'm going to be telling you how this edition is different, and how to use it's features.</p>
        <h2>How it's different</h2>
        <p>Let's start with some of the biggest things.</p>
        <p>For a lot of the things I'll be showing you, we're going to have to make a world. You can do this too, if you want.
        <br>Start by clicking Play > My worlds > Create world. Now change the settings to your liking. For this, we're going to be using creative mode with cheats enabled. You can adjust any of the other settings if you want.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/mcee-worldcreate-screen.png" width="50%">
        <p>Click the play button to create your world, and we're ready!</p>
        <h3>#1: The code editor</h3>
        <p>Arguably, the main attraction of the education edition is it's code builder. It's a fun, simple, and easy way to modify the game while teaching kids how to code.</p>
        <p>Press c to start coding and an Agent will spawn where you are standing. A GUI will pop up on your screen, prompting you to pick an editor.</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/mcee-code-select.png" width="50%">
        I won't be giving you a tutorial on how to use this feature, but they have some tutorials once you click on on of the options.</p>
        <h3>#2: The Camera</h3>
        <p>A camera is a feature I've wanted in java edition for a while, but I can at least enjoy it here in education. Cameras can only be accessed from the creative menu.
         To get it, open your inventory by pressing E and search for "Camera". Then drag the camera from the search results into your hotbar so that you can use it.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/mcee-camera-get.png" width="50%">
        <p>With your new camera, press right click to take a picture. When you do, your photo will show up on your screen for a second and then go away.</p>
        <div id="gallery">

        </div>
        <p>Use the portfolio item (obtained in a similar way to the camera) to view the photos you've taken, and add captions.</p>
        <p>You can even add your photos to books using the icons at the bottom of each page!</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/mcee-camera-book.png" width="50%">
        <h3>#3: Chemistry</h3>
        <p>There's chemistry in Minecraft :flushed:</p>
        <p>So uhh that's cool mr science teacher but I didn't come here to learn.
            <br> That's okay. You don't actually have to know any chemistry to use the feature. Sure, there's all kinds of fancy things you can do with blocks that represent elements of the periodic table.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/mcee-chem-sus.png" width="50%"><img src="/assets/images/mcee-chem-table.png" width="50%">
        <p>But that's BORING!!! We want the good stuff. Well you're in luck because to keep it exciting they added in some custom items for the chemistry feature!
        <br> Now these items are not exactly easy to come by, you can't find them in the creative inventory or give them to yourself with cheats. You actually have to <em>Make them</em>. I know.<br>
        But never fear! The <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/world/a8e2eedc-bd78-4092-ba91-23324bd01498" target="_blank">Chemistry Tutorial</a> world template shows you how to make them, and even makes some of them for you!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            And now... the moment you've been waiting for... The items!<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Balloons! They can be attached to animals and make them float away, and can also be attached to fence posts.</li>
                <li>Super Bone Meal: Like bonemeal but it crows crops and saplings instantly!</li>
                <li>Sparkler: An item that for a short amount of time leaves a trail of sparkles and gives off a glow.</li>
                <li>Glow sticks: When activated, gives of a glow!</li>
                <li>And more! Check out the chemistry tutorial pdf (see below) for all items.</li>
            </ul>
