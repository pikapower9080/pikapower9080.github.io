       <h1>Learn HTML - Lesson 2</h1>
       <p>You should now have your first HTML webpage, and if you don't check out the <a href="index.html">last tutorial</a>. That's awesome! But it's not very good looking and it has nothing on it except a basic heading! In this lesson, we'll learn about some different tags you can use to add content to your webpage.</p>
       <h2>Headings</h2>
       <p>There are six heading sizes you can use in HTML. The biggest heading is h1 and the second biggest is h2, etc all the way up to h6, which is super small.</p>
       <h2>Paragraphs & Text</h2>
       <p>Of course the most important part of your web page is almost always the text content. The <span class="term">&ltp&gt</span> tag will create a paragraph on your page. There's no need for any quotes when using text in HTML by the way.</p>
       <p>What about formatting? Well, there's a couple tags for that too. the <span class="term">&ltem&gt</span> tag will make text italic and the <span class="term">&ltstrong&gt</span> tag will make text bold. The <span class="term">&ltu&gt</span> tag will make text <u>underlined</u> and the <span class="term">&lts&gt</span> tag will make your text <s>strikethough.</s></p>
       <p>If you wanted to add a new line to your paragraph, you might have noticed that it won't work. Adding a new line in the p element won't actually do anything. Instead you have to use the <span class="term">&ltbr&gt</span> tag to insert a line break character. This is another one of those tags that doesn't need to be closed.</p>
       <h2>Images</h2>
       <p>Images from anywhere on the internet can be loaded into your webpage, how cool is that? The <span class="term">&ltimg&gt</span> tag is one of the only tags in HTML that doesn't get closed. This is because there's no text to put inside of the image tag, since it's just an image. To tell our computer what image to insert, we need to set its <span class="term">src</span> attribute. Every HTML tag can have attributes, which are settings for that tag. In this case, we'll be setting an attribute called src which is short for "source". Attributes are set by adding a space between the name of the tag and the greater than sign after it. Then you type the name of the attribute, and equals sign, and the value of the attribute in quotes. For example, <span class="term">&ltimg src="(url here)"&gt</span>.</p>
       <p>The image url must be a direct link to an image file that ends in .png, .jpg, .webp or any other <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types" target="_blank">valid image extension</a>. A great way to put an image on your site is to use <a href="https://imgur.com" target="_blank">imgur</a> which is a meme / image hosting site. Click on New Post and upload your image. You'll be taken to a page with a url that should look something like: https://imgur.com/a/abcxyz if you try to add this to an image's src attribute, it won't work. This is because that link leads to an entire web page and not just an image. What you need to do is right click on the image and select "Copy Image Address" or "Copy Image Location" depending on your browser. Then paste that link in to the src element, since that's a direct link. Notice how it ends in an extension? You can do this with any image you find online, even on google images.</p>
       <h2>Links</h2>
       <p>You can add links to your webpage too, using the <span class="term">&lta&gt</span> tag. Much like images, the a tag (short for anchor) uses the href attribute to tell the computer what page to take you to. <span class="term">&lta href="https://google.com/"&gtClick me!&lt/a&gt</span> will take you to google when clicked! The link text gets placed between the opening and closing a tag.</p>
       <p>You can add more than one attribute into a tag by adding a space after the closing quote and repeating the process. For links, you can add the <span class="term">target</span> attribute with the value set to "_blank" to have the link open in a new tab.</p>
       <h3>Lists</h3>
       <p>You can add bullet and numbered lists to your web pages using the <span class="term">&ltul&gt</span> and the <span class="term">&ltol&gt</span> tags. To create a list, start by opening the tag of your choice (ul or ol). ul is short for unorganized list (bullets) and ol is short for organized list (numbers). Inside of that tag add as many <span class="term">&ltli&gt</abbr></span> elements as you want with your text.</p>
