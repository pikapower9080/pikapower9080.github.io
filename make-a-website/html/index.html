       <h1>Learn HTML</h1>
       <p>HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language is the programming language of the web. It allows you to create basic web pages with headings, text, images, and more. You can use the HTML viewer button at the bottom right of this page to test out HTML code on the fly. You can also interact with any of the code examples here by changing the code and seeing what happens. Just keep in mind that if you want to do some actual work, the preview code won't save, but the button in the bottom right will. Every good HTML file starts out with a basic shell. Here's an example of a blank HTML document:</p>
       <iframe src="/tools/html-sandbox/embed/?code=7f3236a009368e2cff5d35b0c8897849" class="sample"></iframe>
       <p>Let's walk through the components. The first line &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt tells the computer that this is an HTML document. The second line &lthtml&gt is a tag. Tags open with &lttagname&gt and most of the time get closed by &lt/tagname&gt. The html tag contains everything in the document. Next comes the &lthead&gt tag. This tag basically contains the settings for your site. You won't find any images or text in this part. The &lttitle&gt tag can be found inside of the head tag. The title tag contains the page's title which shows up in the browser tab.</p>
       <p>Last is the most important part. The &ltbody&gt tag. This is the tag that contains all of your text, images, heading, etc. Without the body tag, your HTML document would be blank. Let's create a <span class="term">&lth1&gt</span> tag inside of the body tag. (You can do this in the HTML viewer or in the sample above) Type whatever text you want into the tag and then remember to close it with <span class="term">&lt/h1&gt</span>. You should now have a boring looking heading at the top left of your preview.</p>
       <p>Congrats! You just made the world's simpilest website, are you proud of yourself? You should be! Go get into some real action, check out the next lesson.</p>
