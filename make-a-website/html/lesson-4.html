      <h1>Learn HTML - Lesson 4</h1>
      <p>If you want to be a "true" coder and boost your productivity, you'll have to learn all about VS Code.</p>
      <p>We touched on this a bit in the last lesson, but I'll bet this strange new program is still confusing for you, unless you've done this kind of thing before. Even if you are a seasoned VS Code expert, but you're just new to HTML, I'l recommend you still read this part, but you can skip over some of the generic stuff since we'll be talking about HTML specific stuff too like <a href="#emmet">Emmet</a>.</p>
      <p>So first let's talk about customization. VS Code has so many ways to make it feel like yours. You already installed the Live Server extension, but there are tons of other extensions on the marketplace. You can find the marketplace by clicking on the extensions icon on the side bar. Here you can search for any extension or theme that your hear desires.</p>
      <p>Here's a couple that I recommend:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker" target="_blank">Code Spell Checker</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme" target="_blank">Material Icon Theme</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.material-theme" target="_blank">One Dark Pro (theme)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shubham-saudolla.lilac" target="_blank">Lilac Theme</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you can't find any themes you like, or you're just really dedicated, you can <em>make your own</em> at <a href="https://themes.vscode.one/" target="_blank">this website</a></p>
      <p>With that out of the way, let's learn some tricks.</p>
      <h2>Outline</h2>
      <p>This isn't something I use a ton, but it's still pretty neat. On the left panel where you see all the files (make sure you've switched back to the main file icon on the sidebar) there should be a tab called "outline". Here you'll find a list of all your nested tags, and you can jump to one at any time. This is great for super complex documents.</p>
      <img src="../images/vscode-outline.png" class="img-small">
      <p>Similarly, the bar underneath your current open file tab has a list of nested folders and elements that you can click on to jump to them.</p>
      <h2>Global Find / Replace</h2>
      <p>Most text editors have find and replace, including VS Code. You can search for something in your current document by pressing ctrl+f for find. You can then use the dropdown to replace all of those results with another string.<br>But what if you want to search every document in your workspace (opened folder)? To do that, you first must make sure you have an entire workspace open and not just a file. Go to file > open folder to fix this. Then click the magnifying class on the side bar. This feature is similar to searching in just your document, but it will search in ALL documents in the folder which is a lifesaver.</p>
      <h2>Create files & folders</h2>
      <p>In VS Code you can create files and folders in your workspace without leaving the app! Simply hover over the title of your workspace (folder) in the file view and click the file with a plus to create a new file in the parent directory of the file you're editing, or the folder you've selected. Type the name of the file (with the extension) and then press enter. You can do something similar with folders. However if I have three folders and they're all empty except for the next folder, VS Code will display them like folder/folder/folder in one go instead of a bunch of nested empty folders.</p>
      <h2>Code Minimap</h2>
      <p>On the very right side of your window is a code minimap. This is a tiny version of your code that's useful for navigating super long documents. It's not super useful for basic files, but it can come in handy for large ones. You can click on an area of the minimap to scroll to that location in the actual document.</p>
      <h2 id="emmet">Emmet</h2>
      <p>This is a big one, and it could even be it's own lesson. <span class="term">Emmet</span> is a built-in VS Code tool that helps you write HTML much faster. Fireship explains the basics way better than I could in less than a minute with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ZtyMdRzvi0w" target="_blank">YouTube short</a>. But here's the basics:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>You can create an element and it's closing tag by just typing it's name and pressing tab or enter. So instead of typing out <span class="term">&ltp&gt&lt/p&gt</span> you can just type out <span class="term">p</span> and it will be autocompleted for you. This works with any element too!</li>
          <li>You can add a class (more on that in the CSS tutorial!) to an element by typing <span class="term">p.classname</span></li>
          <li>You can add an id to an element and <em>also</em> add a class by typing <span class="term">p.class#id</span> and pressing enter.</li>
          <li>You can set an element attribute by typing <span class="term">element[attribute="value"]</span> and pressing enter when the Emmet Abbreviation comes up. So for example to create a link that opens in a new tab you could do <span class="term">a[target="_blank"]</span>. When create link elements with emmet it will automatically add an href attribute and put your cursor into it, so you don't have to add that specifically.</li>
          <li>You can add an element to be nested inside of an element by using <span class="term">&gt</span> so for example <span class="term">ul>li</span> will create a bulleted list with a list item inside.</li>
          <li>You can use <span class="term">*</span> to create multiple elements. This is super useful when making lists. For example, <span class="term">ul>li*5</span> will create 5 list items inside of a bulleted list. You can use the greater than sign to put content into that element too, and the dollar sign can be used an index. For example <span class="term">ul>li*5>lorem</span> will create 5 list elements each with their own Lorem Ipsum sample text.</li>
          <li>There's so much more that you can do, but that's the basics.</li>
        </ul>
